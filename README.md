## About the Video Course
This course creates a jQuery game called Wack a Mole from scratch. The videos include step-by-step instructions on how to set up your page elements for the gameplay.

After that, we set up interactive game elements, event handlers, and gameplay timers. In conclusion, we add an end game and restart setup. The course is designed in a fun way to help you practice and learn jQuery. Game developers and jQuery developers will benefit from this course.
